      <para id="id4740306">Our predecessors and the people of early civilisations were very aware of their dependence on natural resources. From the earliest times, people settled where they had access to food and water. They lived as nomads, wandering around in search of grazing, food and water. In time they became farmers and settled down for longer periods of time in places where the natural resources were adequate. Eventually people discovered mineral resources, e.g. iron and copper. This made it possible to produce objects for adorning themselves and for domestic wares, as well as weapons like arrowheads that helped them to hunt animals for food and defend themselves against their enemies.</para>
      <para id="id5108809">Although we are less aware of our dependence on natural resources, we do need many different resources for our survival.</para>
