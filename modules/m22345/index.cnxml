      <title>NATURE CONSERVATION AREAS AND ENVIRONMENT</title>
      <para id="id5634343">The United Nations Organisationâ€™s ideal is that countries should manage 10% of their territory as nature conservation areas. In South African terms this would include National Parks (like the Kruger National Park), reserves that are managed by the Departments of Nature Conservation of the different provinces, reserves that are under municipal control, as well as land owned privately, e.g. by mining companies and other organisations and farmers who manage a section of their land as reserves, game parks and game farms.</para>
      <para id="id7492433">South Africa is not doing too well in this field, because only 7% of the country was managed as nature conservation areas in 2000. This situation may be improving as more land is continually being added to land that has already been set aside for conservation.</para>
