      <para id="id1166749333747">In the past, and also today, running water was very important when deciding where to settle. Nowadays technology makes it possible to take water to where people settle. People do not have to settle close to water any more.</para>
      <para id="id1166748657817">The Vaal Dam supplies almost all the water in Gauteng and the western part of Mpumalanga. But, the needs of the population and the industries have increased so greatly that water has to be brought from the Katse Dam in Lesotho, almost 300 km away, to add to the water from the Vaal Dam. Engineers are designing enormous dams, tunnels and pipelines to transport water to Gauteng to ensure development in that region. </para>
      <para id="id2998236">Technology has also had a negative impact on the settlement of people in the Northern Cape and in other parts of the country. Copper wire used to be important as a conductor in telephone systems. Now optic fibres have replaced copper. Copper mines in South Africa, as well as in other parts of the world had to be closed down.</para>
      <para id="id1166749013984">Copper mines near places like Prieska and Springbok in the dry and sparsely populated Northern Cape used to provide many employment opportunities, but many people left the area when the mines were closed and those who have stayed behind are surviving with difficulty.</para>
      <para id="id1166751560220">
        <emphasis effect="bold">There are limitations to what can be done,  though, because people are able to build dams  and canals, but they cannot make water.  Eventually there will not be enough water to  allow unlimited expansion!</emphasis>
