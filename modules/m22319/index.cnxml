      <title>The SUN as a resource</title>
      <para id="id1168221777403">The energy that can be obtained from the sun (solar energy) is very difficult to understand. It is 9 000 times more than all the energy that is currently generated all over the world! And it cannot be used up!</para>
      <para id="id4092705">Unfortunately, we do not yet know how to use solar energy on a large scale. The climate and the weather, and the fact that there is something like night and day, also have a great effect on the use of solar energy. Where solar energy can be used on a small scale, the technology is still also very expensive.</para>
      <para id="id8056916">But there are ways of using solar energy. Solar panels can be used to heat water for houses, and solar cells can be used to generate electricity .</para>
      <para id="id8190836">By the time you are grown up, someone might have discovered how to utilise the energy from the sun better. Perhaps one of you might have a share in such a wonderful discovery!</para>

      <title>The MOON as a resource</title>
      <para id="id8671362">Perhaps it is a surprise to you to read that the moon is a resource for people! Just like the sun has 9 000 times more energy than we can generate, the moon has 100 times more energy to use. </para>
      <para id="id1168221925767">You know that the moon causes tides in the sea, and by using the tides we can generate electricity. By building a closed bay with a sea wall with gates, the flow of the water can be used to generate electricity. </para>
      <para id="id6891387">This method is used in very few places in the world, because there are still too many problems to be overcome.</para>

      <para id="id8186521">The wind has been used as a resource for many centuries. Think of the sailing ships, the Dutch who pump water back to the sea with their well-known windmills, the windmills on many farms in our country, and so on.</para>
      <para id="id1971993">However, at the moment scientists are investigating the use of wind on a much larger scale. The ideal is that the wind should be used on a large scale to generate electricity. In the USA and Europe this type of project has been going on for a long time. In 2002 the first wind power station was constructed in South Africa. This was on the farm Windhoek between Darling and Yzerfontein on the West Coast. (Does the name of the farm say anything?)</para>
