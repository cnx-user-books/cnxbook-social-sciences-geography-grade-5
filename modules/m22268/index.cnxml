      <title>THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE</title>
      <para id="id1171567969053">The landscape as we see it with valleys, hills, lakes, dams, etc. changes constantly. The changes are caused by either people, or forces of nature.</para>

        <item>During the rainy season the water that falls on the earth, gathers in small streams and eventually become rivers that find a downhill path to the sea. The movement of the water over the soil not only takes the topsoil along, but also breaks down the soil and rocks into smaller particles. Over long periods the rivers become deeper and wider. Eventually valleys and ravines are formed. Think of the Fish River Canyon in Namibia.<figure id="id1171571068119"><media id="id1171571068119_media" alt=""><image mime-type="image/png" src="../../media/Picture 15.png" id="id1171571068119__onlineimage" height="244" width="319"/></media></figure><figure id="id1171568883788"><media id="id1171568883788_media" alt=""><image mime-type="image/png" src="../../media/Picture 18.png" id="id1171568883788__onlineimage" height="98" width="279"/></media></figure></item>

        <item>The onslaught by nature, e.g. frost, hail, snow and sun, causes rocks to become more porous. The rocks are eroded over a long period and small pieces break off. When the wind and the rain carry the particles away, we call the movement of the material erosion. The small particles are later deposited elsewhere. A new and fertile layer of soil is then formed.</item>
        <item>When this process continues over a long period, the landscape changes. Valleys, hills and ravines are formed. The softer types of rock erode faster than the surrounding harder rock, therefore creating interesting landscapes, such as the table-top hills in the Great Karoo.</item>

        <item>The outermost layer of the earth is called the crust and consists of rocks. Deep inside the earth the heat is so intense that the rock melts and magma (molten rock) is formed. This boiling mass is always looking for a weak spot in the crust of the earth through which it can escape. When the molten rock reaches the surface of the earth, it is called lava. It cools down, coagulates and forms new rock, thus creating a new landscape. The crater of rock is sometimes so big that a high mountain is formed.<figure id="id1171566707888"><media id="id1171566707888_media" alt=""><image mime-type="image/png" src="../../media/graphics2-ee03.png" id="id1171566707888__onlineimage" height="204" width="245"/></media></figure></item>

        <item>The crust of the earth is constantly exposed to thrust and tractive powers as a result of the unstable core of the earth. It sometimes happens that a part of the crust of the earth is pushed up from underneath and then protrudes above the rest of the landscape. The edge or slope of the earthâ€™s crust where the movement took place is known as a fault. Sometimes the different rock layers underneath the crust of the earth are exposed.</item>
